    abstract = {The synthesis and characterization of new push-pull chromophores A and B, from tricyanofuran (TCF) electron withdrawing and various electron donating moieties, have been demonstrated to compare the roles of donors in electro-optic performance. The crystal structure analyses of the intramolecular hydrogen bond, molecular coplanarity and $\pi$–$\pi$ interactions reveal that A forms cross-stacking, while B forms antiparallel dimer packing, which indicates weaker intermolecular interactions of A than B. Also, the photophysical properties, solvatochromic behavior and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were also investigated. In electro-optic activities, the doped films-A containing chromophore A display an r33 value of 36 pm V−1 at the saturated doping concentration of 40 wt{\%}, while the doped films-B containing B show a maximum r33 value of 16 pm V−1 at the saturated concentration of 25 wt{\%}. High loading density and high r33 value indicate that the chromophore A with julolidinyl-based donor can efficiently reduce the interchromophore electrostatic interactions and enhance the macroscopic optical nonlinearity, showing that chromophore A with julolidinyl-based donor has promising applications in nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.},

Analytical data on lake water sampled before and during eruptions in 1982 showed that the concentrations of polythionates decreased and sulfate increased in response to the preeruption activities of the subaqueous fumaroles. These changes were observed 2 months before the first phreatic explosion on 26 October 1982. The monitoring of polythionates and sulfate in crater lake water is a promising means of anticipating potential volcanic eruption hazards.},

In particular, the dependence of molecular first hyperpolarizability upon dielectric permittivity and optical frequency is defined as is the dependence of electric field poling-induced acentric order on a variety of intermolecular electrostatic interactions. A number of measurement techniques are used to obtain independent test of theoretical predictions of chromophore order. The conclusion of these studies is that electro-optic activity of even complex materials (multi-chromophore-containing dendrimers and composite materials containing several types of chromophores, i.e., binary chromophore organic glasses) can be predicted from first principles theory. Laser-assisted electric field poling applied to a binary chromophore organic glass is used to provided an additional test of theory. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

It consists of a three step mechanism, which involves, first, the sequential formation of N,N′-dichloro-1,3-diaminopropane starting from 1,3-diaminopropane and sodium hypochlorite, second, a dehydrohalogenation of the dichloro derivative leading to 1-pyrazoline and 2-pyrazoline and finally, the hydrogenation of these two derivatives in order to obtain the compound of interest. In this paper, our study was focused on the kinetics of the formation of 1-pyrazoline and 2-pyrazoline. A kinetic model was proposed and then validated by experimental results. A quantum calculation (Gaussian09/CBS-QB3) was performed in order to determine the stability of the 1 and 2-pyrazolines. It showed that the 2-pyrazoline is more stable than the 1-pyrazoline. This process has been validated on the ISOCHEM production site.},

    abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The origin of the two prominent solvatochromic near-UV/visible/near-IR absorptions observed for donor-($\pi$-bridge)-acceptor chromophores with ferrocene donors has been investigated using TD-DFT methods. Both chromophores with relatively weak (4-nitrophenyl) and strong acceptors (1,3-diethyl-2- thiobarbituric acid and 3-dicyanomethylidene-2,3-dihydrobenzothiophene-1,1- dioxide) were considered, as were ferrocene and octamethylferrocene donors. Computational predictions of optical properties made using the B3PW91 functional were found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The calculations reveal a complex orbital picture that varies from compound to compound, contribution of multiple configurations to some of the important states, and significant contributions from more than one transition to the experimentally observed bands. Natural transition orbitals have been used to gain an understanding of the charge redistribution associated with the transitions. The relatively weak low-energy bands of the ferrocene derivatives were generally found to have both d-d and metal-to-$\pi$-bridge/acceptor charge-transfer character. The stronger higher energy bands were found to be associated with charge transfer from cyclopentadienyl rings and the $\pi$ bridge toward the acceptor group. The experimental spectra of ruthenocene chromophores differ significantly from those of the analogous ferrocene chromophores; however, the calculations reproduce the key differences and indicate a similar origin for the contributing transitions. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Unfortunately, current technologies fall short of these criteria. Recently, plasmonics has emerged as a solution offering compact and fast devices. Yet, practical implementations have turned out to be rather elusive. Here, we introduce a 70 GHz all-plasmonic Mach-Zehnder modulator that fits into a silicon waveguide of 10$\mu$m length.

This reaction has been applied to the preparation of chalcone, flavanone, 1,3-diarylpropane derivatives, and a new family of macrocycles in a single step. This condensation is found to be accelerated by microwave activation either in a polar solvent (e.g., H2O) or without solvent, starting from aldehydes or by means of acetals. The magnesium oxide crystal has been applied as catalyst. It has also been observed that the reactants with substituent groups in either of the two aromatic rings undergo the Claisen–Schmidt condensation at a slower rate than the unsubstituted reactants.},

Their optical, electrochemical properties were investigated using UV-vis, photoluminescence spectra and cyclic voltammetry. The molecular orbital energy levels and excitation energies were calculated by quantum chemical calculation. It was found that the fluorescence intensity is decreasing with formation of charge-transfer state. The existence of electron donating group on triphenylamine unites caused a significant bathochromic shift of the UV absorption maximum and increased EHOMO and ELUMO. The electrochromic property of the synthesized compounds was studied by spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results showed that the chalcones containing triphenylamine moiety presented good electrochromic stability, with a color change from yellow to blue as applied potentials ranging from 0.0 to 2.8 V. The coloring and bleaching time was in the range of 2.9-4.2 s and 1.7-3.3 s, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A distinctive feature of the 7-DBA-VQPhV-TCF chromophore is predominance of negative solvatochromism over the positive one, which is quite rarely met for the chromophores manifesting inverse solvatochromic behavior as well as the blue shift of the absorption maximum compared to the chromophore FTC with divinylthiophene $\pi$-bridge. Introduction of quinoxaline moiety in the conjugated bridge promotes the increase of thermal stability: Td of both compounds is higher than 225 °C. Density functional theory was used to calculate the chromophores first hyperpolarizability ($\beta$). Quadratic NLO response characterized by d33 coefficient was measured by SHG technique for thin guest-host polymer films. The influence of chromophore content on the NLO coefficient of 7-DBA-VQPhV-TCF/PMMA film has been investigated and the d33 value of this film reaches 108 pm/V at 25 wt{\%} load. The poled film 7-DBA-VQPh-DCV/PMMA shows twice smaller d33 values (30 pm/V) at the same chromophore load (20 wt{\%}).},

Using a relatively simple model, a candidate class of chromophores, namely cyanine-like polymethines, is identified based on promising microscopic nonlinear optical properties in the near-IR spectral region. The challenges associated with translating these microscopic properties into materials with macroscopic properties suitable for device applications are presented along with molecular engineering approaches for overcoming these hurdles. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This fluorescence probe had a high selectivity only toward Hg2+ ion in the 19 metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Cr2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Al3+ and Cr3+). It was observed that Hg2+ ions significantly decrease the fluorescence intensity of K1, but the fluorescence intensity of K1 did not changed in the presence of the other metal ions. Limit of detection (LOD) value was calculated as 0.16 µM for Hg2+ while the binding constant was calculated as 4.69 × 105 M−2 via fluorescence measurements. The values obtained by this study were very good compared to our previous Hg2+ sensor study which was realized with a different pyrazoline compound. The interaction between of K1 and Hg2+ was not interfered by the presence of other metal ions. In addition, the type of interaction was reversible. It was found that the relative standard deviations (RSD) of three measurements were less than 15{\%} with the real sample tests performed in the tap water and its response time was less than 0.5 min. In conclusion, the new pyrazoline derivative K1 is a highly selective and sensitive fluorescence probe for the detection of Hg2+ ion and it has a great chance for practical application.},

Lactic acid has many applications. Its existence in the form of two stereoisomers does in fact make the application of one of them or of the racemic mixture of great concern in different fields. In particular, the food and pharmaceutical industries have a preference for the isomer l(+), the only one that can be metabolized by the human body; however, the chemical industry requires one of the pure isomers or a mixture of both, according to the application. This review describes biotechnological processes to obtain lactic acid from polymeric substrates such as starchy and lignocellulosic materials. Open challenges are related to the technological optimization of the fermentation process and product purification and recovery. In addition, the opportunities and difficulties associated with using raw materials for lactic acid production are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {A scalable, one-pot, enantioselective catalytic synthesis of 2-pyrazolines from beta-substituted enones and hydrazines is described. Pivoting on a two-stage catalytic Michael addition/condensation strategy, the use of an aldehyde to generate a suitable hydrazone derivative of the hydrazine was found to be key for curtailing background reactivity and tuning the catalyst-controlled enantioselectivity. The new synthetic method is easy to perform, uses a new and readily prepared cinchona-derived bifunctional catalyst, is broad in scope, and tolerates a range of functionalities with high enantioselectivity (up to {\textgreater}99:1 e.r.). The significant scalability of this methodology was demonstrated with the synthesis of more than 80 grams of a pyrazoline product with 89 {\%} catalyst recovery.},

The condensation reaction between Ph 2 Si(OC(O)CH 3 ) 2 and OP(OSiMe 3 ) 3 leads to elimination of CH 3 C(O)OSiMe 3 and the formation of the new silicophosphate cage molecule Ph 12 Si 6 P 4 O 16 (1) with an adamantane-like core possessing four terminal P=O moieties and six O-SiPh 2 -O bridging groups. Compound 1 was further reacted with the Lewis acid B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 . We observed adduct formation by coordination through the P=O→B bonds and isolated and structurally characterized two new molecules. In the first of them, the adamantane-like cage is preserved and three phosphoryl oxygen atoms coordinate to boranes, forming Ph 12 Si 6 O 16 P 4 {\textperiodcentered}3B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (2); the remaining P=O group is inverted toward the cage center pointing along a C 3 molecular axis. The molecule is chiral, and the compound 2 crystallizes as a conglomerate of homochiral crystals. Enantiomers 2M and 2P were both structurally characterized. The second adduct resulted from an unexpected reorganization of the Si-O-P linkages in the adamantane cage during the reaction of 1 with 4 equiv of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 . The bis-adduct Ph 6 Si 3 O 8 P 2 {\textperiodcentered}2B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (3) was formed with an inorganic core representing half of the parent molecule 1.},

    abstract = { Under microwave (MW) irradiation at a proper temperature, three chromophores ( A , B and C ) with julolidinyl-based donors and TCF or CF 3 -Ph-TCF acceptors have been synthesized in high overall yields compared with the conventional heating method.  Under microwave (MW) irradiation at a proper temperature, three chromophores ( A , B , C ) with julolidinyl-based donors and TCF or CF 3 -Ph-TCF acceptors have been synthesized in high overall yields compared with the conventional heating method. The introduction of a MW heating approach in the synthesis of these chromophores proved to markedly shorten reaction times, reduce by-products and increase the efficiency. The solvatochromic behavior and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements suggested that chromophores B and C with stronger acceptors can be more easily polarized with respect to chromophore A . The solvent dependence of the relevant theoretical parameters including dipole moment ( $\mu$ ), first-order polarizability ( $\alpha$ ), hyperpolarizability ( $\beta$ ) and bond-length alternation (BLA) of all chromophores were also studied by DFT calculations. All these chromophores showed good thermal stability and large $\beta$ values. In an electro-optic (EO) activities test, the guest–host poled polymer A / APC exhibited the highest EO coefficient ( r 33 ) of 192 pm V −1 at 1.31 $\mu$m. The MW-assisted syntheses and systematic analyses afforded a rational design for NLO chromophores, and provided a new method to optimize the structures of the chromophores to achieve higher r 33 values. },

@article{Chio2019,
    abstract = {Precise control of covalent bond formation in the presence of multiple functional groups is pertinent in the development of many next-generation bioconjugates and materials. Strategies derived from bioorthogonal chemistries are contributing greatly in that regard; however, the gain of chemoselectivity is often compromised by the slow rates of many of these existing chemistries. Recent work on a variation of the classical aldehyde/ketone condensation based on ortho-carbonylphenylboronic acids has uncovered markedly accelerated rates compared to those of the simple carbonyl counterparts. The products of these reactions are distinct, often in the form of boron-nitrogen heterocycles. In particular, we have shown that 2-formylphenylboronic acid (2fPBA), when coupled with an $\alpha$-amino-hydrazide, produces a unique zwitterionic and stable 2,3,1-benzodiazaborine derivative. In this work, we apply this chemistry to generate chemically defined and functional bioconjugates, herein illustrated with immunoconjugates. We show that an antibody and a fluorophore (as payload) equipped with the relevant reactive handles undergo rapid conjugation at near-stoichiometric ratios, displaying a reaction half-life of only 5 min with 2 equiv of the linker payload. Importantly, the reaction can be extended to multicomponent labeling by partnering with the popular strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition and tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene (Tz-TCO) ligation. The mutual orthogonality to both of these chemistries allows simultaneous triple bioorthogonal conjugations, a rare feat thus far that will widen the scope of various multilabeling applications. Further collaboration with the Tz-TCO reaction enables rapid one-pot synthesis of a site-specific dual-payload antibody conjugate. Altogether, we envision that the 2fPBA-$\alpha$-amino-hydrazide ligation will facilitate efficient assembly of diverse bioconjugates and materials, enabling access to more complex modalities via partnership with other orthogonal chemistries.},

@article{Monson1971,
    abstract = {The developments in organic synthesis in recent years have been as dramatic as any that have occurred in laboratory sciences. One need only mention a few terms to understand that chemical systems that did not exist twenty years ago have become as much a part of the repertoire of the synthetic organic chemist as borosilicate glassware. The list of such terms would include the Wittig reaction, enamines, carbenes, hydride reductions, the Birch reduction, hydroboration, and so on. Surprisingly, an introduction to the manipulations of these reaction techniques for the undergraduate or graduate student has failed to materialize, and it is often necessary for students interested in organic synthesis to approach modern synthetic reactions in a haphazard manner. The purpose of this text is to provide a survey, and systematic introduction to, the modern techniques of organic synthesis for the advanced undergraduate student or the beginning graduate student. An attempt has been made to acquaint the student with a variety of laboratory techniques as well as to introduce him to chemical reagents that require deftness and care in handling. Experiments have been drawn from the standard literature of organic synthesis including suitable modifications of several of the reliable and useful preparations that have appeared in "Organic Synthesis." Other examples have been drawn from the original literature. Where ever possible, the experiments have been adapted to the locker complement commonly found in the advanced synthesis course employing intermediate scale standard taper glassware. Special equipment for the performance of some of the syntheses would include low-pressure hydrogenation apparatus, ultraviolet lamps and reaction vessels, Dry Ice (cold finger) condensers, vacuum sublimation and distillation apparatus, and spectroscopic and chromatographic instruments. In general, an attempt has been made to employ as substrates materials that are available commercially at reasonable cost, although several of the experiments require precursor materials whose preparation is detailed in the text. Some of the reagents are hazardous to handle, but I believe that, under reasonable supervision, advanced students will be able to perform the experiments with safety. Introductory discussion of the scope and mechanism of each reaction has been kept to a minimum. Many excellent texts and reviews exist that provide thorough and accurate discussion of the more theoretical aspects of organic synthesis, and the student is referred to these sources and to the original literature frequently. Since it is the purpose of this volume to provide technical procedures, no useful purpose would be served in merely duplicating previously explicated theoretical material. The number of experiments that can be done satisfactorily in a one-semester course varies widely with the physical situation and the individual skills of the student. Therefore, no attempt is made to suggest a schedule. I recommend, however, that a common core of about five experiments be assigned. The remainder of the preparations can then be chosen by individual students as dictated by their interests as well as by the availability of chemicals and special equipment. The common experiments, representing frequently used and important techniques, might be chosen from Chapter 1, Sections I and IV; Chapter 2, Section I; Chapter 3, Section I; Chapter 4, Section I; Chapter 5, Section I; Chapter 6, Sections III and IV; Chapter 7, Sections II and VI; Chapter 8, Section II; Chapter 9, Sections I and II; Chapter 11, Sections I and III; or Chapter 13, Section II. Since many of the other experiments draw on the products of this suggested list, the possibility of multistep syntheses also presents itself, and several such sequences are outlined in Appendix 1. Also included, in Appendix 2, are the commercial suppliers of the chemicals required when these chemicals are not routinely available. Finally, a brief introduction to the techniques of synthesis is given in Appendix 3. Students with no synthetic experience beyond the first-year organic chemistry course are advised to skim through this section in order to acquaint themselves with some of the apparatus and terminology used in the description of synthetic procedures.},

As these parameters are inter-related, correlated quantum and statistical mechanical calculations are required to understand the dependence of macroscopic electro-optic activity upon chromophore structure and intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Correlated time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and pseudo-atomisticMonteCarlo (PAMC) calculations are used in an attempt to understand the dependence of linear and nonlinear optical properties on dielectric permittivity, optical frequency, and a variety of spatially-anisotropic interactions that can be nano-engineered into the macroscopic material structure. Structure/function relationships are considered for three classes of organic electro-optic materials: (1) Chromophore/polymer composite materials; (2) chromophores covalently incorporated into passive organic host materials; (3) chromophores incorporated into chromophore-containing host materials-a new class of materials referred to as binary chromophore organic glasses (BCOGs). Issues associated with processing these materials into device structures, including those relevant to the integration with silicon photonics, are discussed.

abstract = {A series of donor-acceptor chromophores was prepared in which the spacer separating 4-dimethylanilino (DMA) donor and C(CN)2 acceptor moieties is systematically varied. All of the new push-pull systems, except 4b, are thermally stable molecules. In series a. the DMA rings are directly attached to the central spacer, whereas in series b additional acetylene moieties are inserted. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for seven of the new. intensely colored target compounds, In series a, the DMA rings are sterically forced out of the mean plane of the residual $\pi$ system, whereas the entire conjugated $\pi$ system in series b is nearly planar. Support for strong donor-acceptor interactions was obtained through evaluation of the quinoid character of the DMA ring and by NMR and IR spectroscopy. The UV/Vis spectra feature bathochromically shifted, intense charge-transfer bands, with the lowest energy transitions and the smallest optical gap being measured for the two-dimensionally extended chromophorcs 6 a and 6b. The redox behavior of the push-pull molecules was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the series 1b, 2b, 4b, 5b, in which the spacer between donor and acceptor moieties is systematically enlarged, the electrochemical gap decreases steadily from 1.94V (1b) to 1.53V (5b). This decrease is shown to be a consequence of a reduction in the D-A conjugation with increasing spacer length. Degenerate four-wave mixing experiments reveal high third-order optical nonlinearities, pointing to potentially interesting applications of some of the new chromophores in optoelectronic devices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {Introduction [1] The intellectual heritage of Robert Triffin begins with the relevance of his “dilemma” to our days. We still have a situation in which one national currency – the US dollar – serves as the main international currency. It remains at the heart of the international monetary and financial system (or IMS). And we still have a fundamental tension between the currency demands of rapidly growing economies, the domestic policy incentives of reserve issuing/holding countries, and global economic and financial stability: in Triffin's words, the system remains “highly dependent on individual countries' decisions”. This tension – the Triffin dilemma – was linked to the specific modalities of the gold-exchange standard in 1960, when his Gold and the dollar crisis was first published. Today we are in a much more flexible system, where the demand for global liquidity can be more easily accommodated. But even if the mechanics have changed, the dilemma is still valid if we capture its essence and formulate it in broader terms, as I will do in the first part of my comments today. In second place, I will briefly recall how the dilemma came into being and was addressed in Triffin's times. This will allow me to better identify the main differences and similarities compared with our times, which will lead me to conclude that it is indeed correct to talk about a “Triffin dilemma revisited”. Finally, I will look ahead and ask whether and how it is possible to escape the dilemma today. My main policy conclusion is that we need a number of incentives for the major reserve issuers and holders so as not to cause negative externalities for other countries, thereby helping to ensure global stability. 1. Triffin dilemma: a general formulation Each international monetary and financial system has to rely on one or more international currencies in order to allow economic agents to interact in the global economy by using such currencies as a means of payment, a unit of account or a store of value. When these international currencies are also domestic ones, the supply of global liquidity stems from one or more “core countries”. And when the core countries operate as a monopoly or quasi-monopoly, over time they tend to take advantage of other countries' high dependence on their domestic money. By exploiting this “exorbitant privilege”, the core countries develop policy incentives to accommodate shocks (e.g. the financing of a war) or growth models (e.g. based on over-consumption) that can ultimately be sustained only if the rest of the world unconditionally demands their own liquid, safe assets. However, when policies become too short term-oriented and inward-looking, they tend to produce negative spillovers on the rest of the world (e.g. inflationary pressures or an environment with relatively low yields) and over the longer run may, if there are no rebalancing measures, prove unsustainable and impair the smooth functioning of the IMS. For some time (or even a very long time), however, this behaviour does not jeopardise the international status of the core currencies. This is not only because there are no alternatives, but also because certain systemic countries in the rest of the world have in the meantime developed incentives to increasingly demand assets denominated in the core currencies. Such countries in the “IMS periphery” tend to pursue growth models that match, with opposite sign, those of the core countries and may likewise produce negative externalities: think of the current account surpluses and reserve accumulation, which conflicted with the IMS rules during Bretton Woods times and which contribute to excessively low yields and trade distortions at the present time. Hence the tension, which can sooner or later become a genuine dilemma involving short-term domestic policy incentives in the key reserve issuing/holding countries on the one hand, and the longer-term stability of a given international monetary and financial system on the other. Given this general formulation, however, there is no single way to address the tension here. And indeed many different types of IMS have existed over time. In Triffin's day, some set stringent rules on the system's adjustment and on the availability of global liquidity, as I will recount in a minute. Others, as at present, have instead made it easier to create global liquidity and to finance imbalances while neglecting the system's longer-term stability – an issue which I will discuss later. 2. Triffin dilemma in Triffin's times During the Bretton Woods system, the dollar was the international currency, and the international currency was mainly needed as a means of payment and a unit of account to purchase foreign goods. Given largely closed capital accounts and underdeveloped financial markets, the store of value function was limited, and mainly related to the need to cover any temporary shortage of dollars to import goods from abroad. The other key features of the system were fixed exchange rates vis-{\`{a}}-vis the dollar, the gold convertibility of the dollar, and a mechanism of adjustment of imbalances based on a symmetrical correction of domestic absorption and relative prices in the relevant countries. However, there was no mechanism to impose symmetry in the adjustment process, and adjustment through exchange rate realignments was possible, although it rarely happened. When the Bretton Woods system was launched, in the second half of the 1940s, the huge economic gap with the United States made it difficult for other countries to acquire dollars without US help. By the end of the 1950s, however, the global shortage of dollars was over, thanks to rising dollar-denominated exports. This was welcomed since it implied that countries no longer needed American assistance to obtain dollars in order to address post-war economic problems. Yet it was not entirely good news, as Triffin realised. Countries such as Germany and Japan had indeed started accumulating large current account surpluses and, therefore, dollars in the form of rising official reserves. This implied an accumulation of US monetary liabilities vis-{\`{a}}-vis non-residents. The problem was that the supply of such liabilities by the United States at a fixed exchange rate was elastic to the growing demand, but the American commitment to supply gold upon request at an equally fixed price was not. [2] Already by the early 1960s, US monetary liabilities towards non-residents exceeded US gold holdings. Hence the dilemma, which in Triffin's day took the well-known, specific shape: if the United States refused to provide other countries with US dollars, trade would stagnate and the world economy would eventually be trapped in a deflationary bias; but if the United States provided an unlimited supply of dollars, the confidence that it would convert them into gold would erode confidence in its international currency [3]. The dilemma could, however, be formulated in more general terms. Given the BW rules, there were domestic policy incentives in the key reserve-issuing and holding countries not to comply with these rules, at the expense of the system's sustainability. This is mainly because using the exchange rate as an alternative rebalancing tool was always a temptation which, especially in case of large shocks, offered a politically more palatable option than lengthy and costly domestic adjustment. At the end of the 1960s, the largest of all shocks – the Vietnam War – was financed by the United States with expansionary policies that resulted in high inflationary pressures and took no account of global monetary stability. As a result, the US dollar-denominated reserve assets lost 40{\%} of their purchasing power, thus making the creditors to the United States increasingly reluctant to finance the war by accumulating reserves denominated in dollars. The system eventually collapsed, as Triffin had predicted: faced with the dilemma, the system's core country preferred not to maintain its commitment to keep the value of the dollar in terms of gold, but rather to pursue its internal needs while providing the other countries (which were not adjusting either) with its reserve currency. 3. The dilemma today: What has changed? What is still valid? What has changed since Triffin's times? Well, the way in which the IMS works and thus the modalities through which the dilemma operates have changed considerably; but the fundamental tension between short-term domestic policy incentives and the stability of the IMS has not. Hence the Triffin dilemma is, in its essence, still alive and well. 3.1 What has changed? There have been three major changes. First, we have learned that the BW rules were too stringent. Over the past 40 years, a new informal IMS has been developing which has turned out to be much more elastic in nature than the previous ones. The dollar no longer needs to be “as good as gold”; exchange rate adjustment has become an important element in the rebalancing toolkit; and the IMS has been adapting to the different economic conditions and policy preferences of individual countries. In particular, the exchange rates of all advanced economies and some emerging economies are now freely floating, whereas a new dollar area encompassing systemically relevant creditors has emerged, thus making the IMS an hybrid floating/fixed system. Second, a new globally important currency, the euro, has appeared on the stage. This has had important consequences, but has not meant a shift to a genuine duopoly in the supply of international currencies. While the euro has become a credible alternative to the dollar, this has had little impact on the dollar's centrality in the IMS. In particular, the exorbitant privilege remains largely the dollar's attribute. To be sure, it is undeniable that the very low yield spreads associated, until approximately 2008, with the debt of certain European countries were mainly a by-product of the “privilege” of being part of the eu},

abstract = {The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between organoboron compounds and organic halides or triflates provides a powerful and general methodology for the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. Recently, this reaction has been called the Suzuki coupling, Suzuki reaction, or Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, although we never referred to it as such previously. In this review, this name will be used with hesitation, simply in order to express the coupling reaction. The availability of the reagents and the mild reaction conditions all contribute to the versatility of this reaction. The coupling reaction offers several additional advantages, such as being largely unaffected by the presence of water, tolerating a broad range of functional groups, and proceeding generally regio- and stereoselectively. Moreover, the inorganic by-product of the reaction is non-toxic and easily removed from the reaction mixture thereby making the Suzuki coupling suitable not only for laboratories but also for industrial processes. We published previously a comprehensive review of the reaction (see N. Miyaura, A. Suzuki, Chem. Rev. 95 (1995) 2457 and A. Suzuki, in: F. Diederich, P.J. Stang, (Eds.), Metal-Catalyzed Cross-coupling Reactions, VCH, Weinheim, 1998, pp. 49–97), which covered mainly the references until the end of 1994. Thereafter, a large number of papers related to the coupling reaction have been reported. Consequently, such new results presented from 1995 to May 1998 are summarized in this review. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved. Keywords:},

Mechanistic studies of these ions have generated numerous insights into the origins of stereoselectivity in addition and displacement reactions. However, it has not been clear whether fluorine can form a halonium ion in the same manner. We present chemical and theoretical evidence for the transient generation of a true symmetrical fluoronium ion in solution from an appropriately configured precursor.$\backslash$nFluorine Learns to Share$\backslash$nThough halides typically coordinate to just one carbon center, their transient coordination to a second carbon (forming a positively charged bridge) explains the spatial dynamics of many reactions. However, unlike chlorine, bromine, and iodine—which can all form such halonium ions—fluorine does not appear to engage in carbon-bridging behavior, presumably because of its very high electronegativity.

Cisplatin, as one of the leading metal-based drugs, is widely used in treatment of cancer, being especially effective against genitourinary tumors such as testicular. Significant side effects and drug resistance, however, have limited its clinical applications. Biological carriers conjugated to cisplatin analogs have improved specificity for tumor tissue, thereby reducing side effects and drug resistance. Platinum complexes with distinctively different DNA binding modes from that of cisplatin also exhibit promising pharmacological properties. Ruthenium and gold complexes with antitumor activity have also evolved. Other metal-based chemotherapeutic compounds have been investigated for potential medicinal applications, including superoxide dismutase mimics and metal-based NO donors/scavengers. These compounds have the potential to modulate the biological properties of superoxide anion and nitric oxide.},

    abstract = {A novel trilinkable thiophene-containing second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophore [(HO) 3FTC] was synthesized from a trilinkable donor bridge and a tricyanofuran electron acceptor (TCF). The TCF acceptor was modified with two butyls which greatly increased solubility and processability of the trihydroxy-functionalized chromophore and inhibited strong chromophore-chromophore interaction. A thermal stability study of (HO)3FTC indicates that the free hydroxyl group located close to the cyano acceptor causes the chromophore to decompose at a much lower temperature than FTC chromophores with no free hydroxyl groups. Significantly improved thermal stability of the chromophore in polyurethane film was obtained by masking the free hydroxyl groups with toluene diisocyanate. New polyurethane prepolymer synthetic schemes were designed and studied in detail to improve electric field induced dipole alignment. Enhancement of over 150{\%} in poling efficiency was achieved by reducing the degree of chromophore attachment to polymer backbone before applying an electric poling field through a "guest-host" approach. It was found to be critical to allow isocyanate and hydroxyl cross-linkers to react at higher temperature for a longer time to form a partially cross-linked prepolymer before the-NCO masked trilink chromophore was added. By anchoring chromophores to a three-dimensional cross-linked polyurethane network at three points, the thermal stability of poling-induced electrooptic activity was enhanced by 33 °C.},

The experimental absorption properties have been measured and compared with the computed parameters. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that one conformational isomer (the compressed one) is largely prevalent in all compounds. The measured radiative and reactive relaxation properties of these donor/acceptor disubstituted compounds were also compared with those of the unsubstituted analogues previously investigated. The presence of the donor/acceptor groups leads to a significant increase of the charge transfer character of both the ground and the excited states and to strong red shifts of the absorption spectra, an effect that can be useful for potential applications in material science. The fluorescence/photoisomerization competition of the furan and thiophene derivatives was found to be rather similar to that of the unsubstituted analogues whereas significant changes were found for the pyridine derivatives where a drastic decrease of fluorescence, a sizable increase of photoisomerization and a predominance of radiationless deactivation to the ground state becomes operative. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Pervaporation and vapor permeation were initially investigated for dehydration performances, and the latter showed much better results. The molecular sieve property of the membrane resulted in a high separation factor of over 1000 for all conditions. The maximum flux was 10.24 kg/(m2 h) at a feed temperature of 145 °C, a water feed concentration of 10 wt{\%}, and a feed pressure of 4.0 bars, respectively. For vapor permeation-assisted esterification using synthetic solutions, the productivity and ethyl lactate yield strongly depended on the dehydration rate. Realistic purifications were performed with fermentation broths of Pediococcus pentosaceus as the lactic acid producer. Experimental results revealed that most of the lactic acid was converted into ethyl lactate at the final stage of the reaction. After distillation and hydrolysis, high purity l-(+)-lactic acid was obtained with more than 95{\%} recovery yields. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Background: Pyrazole derivatives have remained a much studied class of heterocyclic compounds with application in several scientific areas such as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and building blocks for more elaborated structures. The cyclocondensation of enones with hydrazine derivatives is one of the most valuable ways of synthesizing pyrazole derivatives. This method produces a racemic mixture of 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles also known as pyrazolines which can be converted into aromatic pyrazoles by oxidative aromatization. Objective: The aim of this review article is to cover the state of the art oxidative aromatization of pyrazolines to pyrazoles. Method: It was performed a comprehensive compilation from the literature concerning the reported methods for oxidative aromatization of pyrazolines from the last thirty years. The review of each method was presented along with a critical point of view. Results: Several oxidant systems were applied for converting pyrazolines into pyrazoles. Most of the reviewed protocols proved to be efficient for oxidize 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazolines when the group attached to the N1 was H, methyl and (substituted)-phenyl. On the other hand few methods were found to dehydrogenate pyrazolines containing other than the above groups on N1 such as (thio) carbamoyl and amidinyl. Conclusion: Conversion of pyrazolines into aromatic pyrazoles by oxidative aromatization attracted attention in the last decades. A range of reagents has been reported for this purpose, but there is still the need for developing general methods that fill the requirements of green chemistry and that are applicable for more elaborated substrates.},

The resulting amorphous polyimides exhibited good solubility and can be easily spin-coated into thin films with good optical quality. The high electro-optic coefficients (r33) obtained for the films of poled polyimides were attributed to the introduction of hetarylazo chromophores with large hyperpolarizability within the polyimides.

abstract = {In this work, the concept ‘city water heating' is introduced. It consists in bringing a significant amount of residual thermal energy (waste heat) from a power plant to a city by means of heating the potable water supplied to this city. For this purpose (i) a great amount of the city water has to be supplied through a single aqueduct, (ii) the aqueduct has to pass near the power station, and (iii) the water supplied to the city has to be colder than the cooling circuit water in the power plant. The hot water generated in the power plant cooling circuit (which is usually dissipated in the cooling tower) is conducted through a pipe to a place near the aqueduct and, by means of a heat exchanger, part of the cooling water heat is then transferred to the colder potable water supplied to the city. This has the great advantage of using the existing city water network itself to transport the heat to the houses. Based on data from a coal power plant located in Asturias (Northern Spain), two city water heating systems of different sizes are described and analysed. The following advantages were found: (i) energy saving and cost reduction for inhabitants, (ii) reduction in global warming and (iii) CO2emissions reduction.},

The electrochemical redox properties of methylenepyrans 5-9 and extended bismethylenepyrans 10, 14, and 15 determined by cyclic voltammetry indicate the formation of redox bistable systems with high bi-stability. Oxidation of the dimers obtained from 5 to 9 was also described. All compounds are colored and slightly fluorescent (except some bismethylenepyran derivatives). Some compound second-order nonlinear optical properties were investigated, and large positive values of $\mu$$\beta$ were obtained.

Here we incorporate a doped, crosslinked organic EO polymer into hybrid polymersol-gel waveguide modulator devices with exceptional performance. The half-wave voltages of the resulting Mach-Zehnder (MZ) and phase modulators at 1550nm are 1V and 2.5V, respectively. The unique properties of the sol-gel cladding materials used in the hybrid structure result in a 100 device poling efficiency, leading to respective in-device EO coefficients of 138pmV-1 and 170pmV-1 in the MZ and phase modulators. These results are the first to show in-device EO coefficients that are five to six times larger than those of the benchmark inorganic material. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

    abstract = {A series of highly polarizable chromophores 1-3 has been synthesized based on three different types of electron donors, including diethylaminophenyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl and julolidinyl groups respectively, with the same isophorone-derived tetraene bridges and strong CF3-TCF acceptors. The progressively increased electron-donating strength for these chromophores allows for the fine-tuning of their molecular ground-state polarization, being very close to optimal for very large hyperpolarizability ([small beta]), as a function of the local dielectric environment and poling-induced acentric ordering. The solvatochromic study and DFT calculations suggested that more dipolar chromophores 2 and 3 with stronger donating groups can be polarized quite close to the cyanine limit, or even beyond that into the zwitterionic regime in the most polar solvents to give the inverted solvatochromism and diminished [small beta] values. This is in stark contrast to the polyene-like characteristic of 1 with the diethylaminophenyl donor in all the tested solvents. Most intriguingly, the electric field poling has induced significant changes in the position, intensity and shape of the chromophoric charge-transfer absorption band in their poled thin films. It is thus indicated that the nontrivial intermolecular interaction in solid state can vary the reaction field that acts on the chromophores in poled and depoled films, and significantly affect their achievable electro-optic (EO) activities. As a result, the guest-host polymers containing 10 wt{\%} of chromophores in PMMA showed EO coefficients of [similar]80 pm V-1 for 1/PMMA and 2/PMMA, while dramatically dropping to 20 pm V-1 for 3/PMMA. These systematic analyses led to the rational design of a new guest-host EO polymer incorporating 35 wt{\%} of a spatially modified chromophore AJLZ55, which gave ultrahigh EO coefficients of 218 pm V-1 at 1.31 [small mu ]m.},

abstract = {Experimental and computational studies of the solvent dependence of the first molecular hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) for two donor-bridge-acceptor chromophores (CLD-1 and YLD156) are presented. Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements are performed with 1907 nm excitation in a series of solvents with dielectric constants ranging from {\~{}}2 (toluene) to {\~{}}36 (acetonitrile). For both chromophores an approximately 2-fold increase in $\beta$ is observed by HRS over this range of dielectric constants. Computational studies employing a polarized continuum model to represent the solvent are capable of reproducing this experimental result. The experimental and computational results are compared to the predictions of the widely employed two-state model (TSM) for $\beta$. Surprisingly, for the chromophores studied here the TSM predicts that $\beta$ should decrease with increasing dielectric constant over the range investigated. The results presented here demonstrate that the TSM provides neither a quantitative nor qualitative description of the solvent dependence of $\beta$ for CLD-1 and YLD156. The enhancement of $\beta$ with increased dielectric constant suggests that modification of the dielectric surrounding the chromophore is one path by which the performance of nonlinear optical devices employing these chromophores may be significantly enhanced.},

    abstract = {This review provides a survey of nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores and materials incorporating them which have been demonstrated over the last several years. Conventional polymeric materials, dendrimers, and other material design approaches are reviewed. Macroscopic nonlinear optical properties are introduced mainly in terms of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and the electro-optic (EO) effect. The temporal and thermal stability of nonlinear optical properties are also discussed. The review begins with a brief introduction explaining overall principles relating to the origin of second-order nonlinear optical properties. The structure of NLO materials, methods for their characterization, and structure-property relationships are also introduced. Much current research is aimed at optimizing microscopic nonlinearity in well-defined heterocyclic NLO chromophores which are then embedded in materials such as polymers, dendrimers, etc. Strong electron density donor and acceptor groups are connected through an efficient $\pi$-electron conjugative bridge to yield a highly electronically asymmetric and hyperpolarizable NLO chromophore. This review highlights the design and synthesis of recent chromophores that simultaneously exhibit large molecular hyperpolarizability, and low optical absorption at an operating wavelength, in addition to good processability and thermal/photochemical stability. Although NLO chromophores have been designed to exploit both dipolar and octupolar symmetry, the former has exhibited the strongest potential for the development of practical NLO devices. Organic materials based on polymers and dendrimers containing dipolar chromophores are mainly demonstrated for nonlinear optics. Experimental results corresponding to such dipolar compounds are mainly considered in this review. In addition, new strategies to improve thermal stabilities are also discussed herein. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To further enhance the NLO coefficient and stability, the "star-type" chromophore was also introduced into hyperbranched polymer to yield P3. All of these polymers were soluble in polar organic solvents and well characterized. Due to the better topological structure and site isolation effect of "star-type" chromophore, the d33 value of P2 was 1.8 times that of its "H-shape" analogue. The results confirmed that the "star-type" chromophore could reduce the intermolecular electrostatic interactions between chromophore moieties effectively, indicating the advantages of a "star-type" chromophore. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

For comparison, guest-host doped polymer films are fabricated by doping chromophore 1 and BF1 into poly(4-vinylphenol). All of these doped films show a saturated trend in second harmonic generation coefficient (d33) and a maximum d33 value between 50-70 pm V-1 around the doping concentration of 25 wt{\%}, due to the strong interchromophore electrostatic interactions. In contrast, GGQ1 films display a d33 value of 192 pm V-1.

The midsection of the $\pi$-electron framework for one dye contained a morpholino-substituted cyclohexenylene unit, and the other dye contained an ethoxysiloxane-substituted cyclohexenylene unit. Guest-host films were deposited on ITO-glass and contact poled. Electro-optic coefficients (r33) were measured at a wavelength of 1550 nm by the attenuated total reflection method and by a modified simple Teng-Man reflection method. The measured values of r33 were compared with values estimated from a well-known model that employs the molecular properties of the dyes and the film poling parameters. Thermal stability and electronic absorption spectra of the dyes were measured. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Long wavelength voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) called Pittsburgh (PGH) dyes were recently synthesized by coupling various heterocyclic groups to a styryl-thiophene intermediate forming extended, partially rigid chromophores. Unlike most styryl VSDs, dyes with a sulfonic acid anchor directly attached to the chromophore showed no solvatochromic absorption shifts. The limited water solubility of many long wavelength VSDs requires the use of surfactants to transport the dye through physiological saline solutions and effectively label biological membranes. Here, we tested the chemical substitution of the sulfonic acid moiety with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) chains, ranging from MW 750 to 5000, to overcome the poor solubility of VSDs while retaining their properties as VSDs. The chemical synthesis of PGH dyes and their PEG derivatives are described. The PEG derivatives were soluble in aqueous solutions ({\textgreater}1 mM) and still reported membrane potential changes. In frog and mouse hearts, the voltage sensitivity (DeltaF/F per action potential) and spectral properties of PEG dyes were the same as the sulfonated analogues. Thus, the solubility of VSDs can be considerably improved with small polyethyleneglycol chains and can provide an effective approach to improve staining of excitable tissues and optical recordings of membrane potential.},

    abstract = {Bioorthogonal chemistry has enabled the development of bioconjugates in physiological environments while averting interference from endogenous biomolecules. Reactions between carbonyl-containing molecules and alkoxyamines or hydrazines have experienced a resurgence in popularity in bioorthogonal chemistry owing to advances that allow the reactions to occur under physiological conditions. In particular, ortho-carbonyl-substituted phenylboronic acids (CO-PBAs) exhibit greatly accelerated rates of hydrazone and oxime formation via intramolecular Lewis acid catalysis. Unfortunately, the rate of the reverse reaction is also increased, yielding a kinetically less stable bioconjugate. When the substrate is a hydrazine derivative, an intramolecular reaction between the boronic acid and the hydrazone can lead to the formation of a heterocycle containing a boron-nitrogen bond. We have shown previously that $\alpha$-amino hydrazides undergo rapid reaction with CO-PBAs to form highly stable, tricyclic products, and that this reaction is orthogonal to the popular azide-alkyne and tetrazine-alkene reactions. In this work, we explore a series of heteroatom-substituted hydrazides for their ability to form tricyclic products with two CO-PBAs, 2-formylphenylboronic acid (2fPBA), and 2-acetylphenylboronic acid (AcPBA). In particular, highly stable products were formed using $\beta$-hydroxy hydrazides and 2fPBA. C-Terminal $\beta$-hydroxy hydrazide proteins are available using conventional biochemical methods, which alleviates one of the difficulties with applications of bioorthogonal chemical reactions: Site-specific incorporation of a reactive group into the biomolecular target. Using sortase-mediated ligation (SML), C-terminal threonine and serine hydrazides were appended to a model eGFP protein in high yield. Subsequent labeling with 2fPBA functionalized probes could be performed quickly and quantitatively at neutral pH using micromolar concentrations of reactants. The SML process was applied directly to an expressed protein in cellular extract, and the C-terminal modified target protein was selectively immobilized using 2fPBA-agarose. Elution from the agarose yielded a highly pure protein that retained the hydrazide functionality. This strategy should be generally applicable for rapid, efficient site-specific protein labeling, protein immobilization, and preparation of highly pure functionalized proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lignocellulose should undergo pretreatment to enhance its enzymatic digestibility before being saccharified. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant that can remove lignin under mild conditions. The sulfuric acid in the PAA solution also can cause degradation of hemicelluloses. The objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of several factors on peracetic acid pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. RESULTS: It was found that PAA charge, liquid/solid (l/s) ratio, temperature, time, interactions between PAA charge and l/s ratio, temperature and time, all had a very significant effect on the enzymatic conversion ratio of cellulose. The relative optimum condition was obtained as follows: PAA charge 50{\%}, l/s ratio 6:1, temperature 80°C and time 2 h. More than 80{\%} of the cellulose in bagasse treated under the above conditions was converted to glucose by cellulase of 20 FPUg-1 cellulose. Compared with H2SO4 and NaOH pretreatments under the same mild conditions, PAA pretreatment was the most effective for enhancement of enzymatic digestibility. CONCLUSION: PAA pretreatment could greatly enhance the enzymatic digestibility of sugarcane bagasse by removing hemicelluloses and lignin, but removal of lignin was more helpful. This study can serve as a step to further optimization of PAA pretreatment and understanding the mechanism of enhancement of enzymatic digestibility.},

Oxidation of pyrazolines, in situ, employing bromine afforded a wide variety of pyrazoles. The methodology offers a fast, and often chromatography-free protocol for the synthesis of 3,4,5-substituted pyrazoles in good to excellent yields.

abstract = {Bioconjugates are multifunctional constructs in which biomolecules like peptides, proteins, vitamins and nucleic acids are endowed with the properties of specific payloads. These constructs recently emerged as a new generation of high-precision therapeutics, with several representatives reaching the market. This success stimulated an intense search for new biocompatible synthetic methodologies to connect both components and to control the bioconjugate's function. Despite the remarkable advances made in this field, most of the technologies developed for the construction of bioconjugates were engineered to yield stable constructs that can endure complex physiological conditions. Because of this, the use of reversible covalent bonds in the synthesis of bioconjugates has been rather overlooked, notwithstanding the potential of this strategy to generate stimuli responsive constructs that may operate in areas like the selective delivery of drugs, live-cell imaging and new theranostic approaches. Boronic acids are a well-known class of reagents that have been widely used in modern synthesis for the formation of C-C and C-heteroatom bonds. Apart from this, boronic acids exhibit an exquisite reversible coordination profile that can be explored as a molecular construction tool featuring specific mechanisms to control the structure and biological properties of bioconjugates. In this review, the use of boronic acids in the construction of therapeutically useful bioconjugates will be discussed, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that allow the use of these reagents as bioconjugation warheads, as central pieces of linker structures and as functional payloads.},

After spectroscopic characterization, the compounds showing the best light harvesting and electrochemical properties were applied as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Interestingly, photovoltaic cells built using the new silanediol dyes showed low power conversion efficiencies ($\eta$), comparable to those obtained with silicon-based sensitizers having simple azobenzene moieties as the light-harvesting units. Such values are mostly due to unsatisfactory photocurrent densities; a computational study suggested that the latter can be justified considering the insufficient degree of charge transfer taking place during photoexcitation of the silicon-containing sensitizers, which is likely to make electron injection into the TiO2 layer less efficient. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Dipolar chromophores consisting of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) groups connected through a conjugated $\pi$-bridge have been actively studied and integrated in optoelectronic and electronic devices. Generally, such $\pi$-conjugated molecules provide substantial delocalization of $\pi$-electrons over the molecules. Here, a brief overview of recent research on D-$\pi$-A dipolar chromophores including their syntheses and several promising applications is reported, especially in nonlinear optical devices and organic photovoltaics. Structure/property relationships are discussed in order to exploit the potentials by tuning the $\pi$-electron density, polarizability, and HOMO-LUMO band gap of the chromophores. Some of the examples may well set the stage for chip-scale integration of optoelectronics as well as the realization of an important array of new device technologies. This article provides a brief review of the current status of research related to D-$\pi$-A dipolar chromophores together with a description of their syntheses and several promising applications in related fields. Structure/property relationships are discussed in order to exploit the potentials by tuning the $\pi$-electron density, polarizability, and HOMO-LUMO band gap of the chromophores.},

The initiation is accomplished by direct or indirect (sensitized) photolysis of the salts. Depending on the type of the salt, the direct photoinitiation of cationic polymerization involves reversible or irreversible processes. The photolysis of phenacylsulfonium compounds proceeds by a reversible process, while the other types undergo irreversible photolysis leading to complete fragmentation of the photoinitiator. An additionally useful tool, namely photosensitized generation of initiating species enlarges the versatility of these salts as photoinitiators. Photoinitiated free-radical and zwitterionic polymerizations by using phenacyl-type salts are also addressed. Keto-enol tautomerization of phenacyl pyridinium salts is discussed. Moreover, an interesting application concerning in situ synthesis of clay-poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposites with the aid of the phenacyl anilinium salt-based photopolymerization technique is noted.},

The compounds were synthesized after two steps employing a Claisen-Schmidt condensation followed by an addition-elimination reaction with phenylhydrazine. All compounds were characterized using NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis, and XRD. We calculated the first-order hyperpolarizabilities of these molecules using program packages based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (DFT). SHG was characterized by Kurtz and Perry's powder method. We observed that these organic crystals present SHG efficiencies up to 5 times larger than the KDP, and we associated these values to their molecular structure and crystalline arrangements. The values obtained experimentally and theoretically evidence that these compounds have good potential for application in electronic devices based on second-order nonlinear responses.},

Experiments in batch, continuous and fed-batch conditions were conducted in a 3 L fully instrumented bioreactor. Final substrate and biomass concentrations, yields and productivities are reported for different culture strategies. A kinetic analysis was conducted to characterize biomass production, product inhibition effects, and substrate consumption rates. Due to the strong product inhibition, fed-batch cultures at high biomass concentration rendered higher productivity (0.45 g L-1 h-1) than batch and continuous cultures (0.11 g L-1 h-1), complete lactose conversions ({\textless}1.0 g of lactose/L at the end of each fed-batch cycle), and a product with higher viable cell counts (2 × 1010 cell/g of freeze-dried product).

Here, we report a novel ink that can be used for the 3D printing of highly stretchable, SM, and SH elastomer via UV-light-assisted direct-ink-write printing. An ink containing urethane diacrylate and a linear semicrystalline polymer is developed for the 3D printing of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network elastomer that can be stretched by up to 600{\%}. The 3D-printed complex structures show interesting functional properties, such as high strain SM and SM -assisted SH capability.

None of the nitrogen source gave lactic acid concentration as high as that for yeast extract. The effect of yeast extract could have been due to its B vitamin content. Acclimatization and ultraviolet mutagenesis were used to develop strains of L. delbrueckii (NCIM 2365) that produced increased lactic acid concentrations. Four mutants (Ac-1, Ac-2, Uc-1 and Uc-3) were compared with the wild type L. delbrueckii with 100 g/l cane sugar concentration in a fermentation medium. All the four mutants produced higher levels of lactic acid with enhanced productivity than the wild type. Lactic acid fermentation from various carbohydrates by both wild strain and mutant Uc-3 was investigated. Sucrose, xylose and maltose were not utilized by both the wild and mutant strains. When the cultures were grown in a fermentation medium containing glucose, fructose, lactose or galactose as a carbon source, the average volumetric productivities exhibited by mutant Uc-3 were higher than those of wild strain. Mutant Uc-3 was compared with wild type, L. delbrueckii NCIM 2365 by fermentation with different concentrations of hydrolyzed cane sugar. The highest lactic acid concentration (135 g/l) in batch fermentation was obtained with 150 g/l of cane sugar with 90{\%} lactic acid yield. Overall, mutants exhibited faster growth rates, shorter lag phases, higher productivity and greater lactic acid yield. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition, the solvent/additive combination can also dictate the stability of heterogeneous catalysts under conditions necessary for facile dioxygen activation for allylic oxidation.

abstract = {To meet the electric power requirement, the world population is greatly dependent on fossil fuel. Presently in India, about 75{\%} of the total electrical energy (i.e. ???100,000 MW) is generated from fossil fuel and about 105 million tons of coal combustion residues (CCRs) as solid waste/by-product is being released annually during combustion of pulverised bituminous, sub bituminous, and lignite coal. Indian coal typically has ash content of 30-60{\%}, which results in low calorific value however low in sulphur, radioactive elements and heavy metals content. Mostly, the CCRs is being disposed to the ash pond as thin slurry, and more than 65,000 acres of land is occupied in India for storage of this huge quantity of ash which leads ecological and environmental problems. Presently about 27{\%} of the total CCRs produced in India is being recycled and used in various applications. The major utilisation is in cement, concrete, bricks, wood substitute products, soil stabilisation, road base/embankment, and consolidation of ground, land reclamation and for agriculture. In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess the global generation of CCRs, present utilisation and acceptability in Indian context, implications and future potentials to achieve environmental sound management. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report the synthesis of four new cationic push–pull membrane probes based on a thiophene core and evaluate their photobiological properties. We report the synthesis of four new cationic dipolar push–pull dyes, together with an evaluation of their photophysical and photobiological characteristics pertinent to imaging membranes by fluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). All four dyes consist of an N , N -diethylaniline electron-donor conjugated to a pyridinium electron-acceptor via a thiophene bridge, with either vinylene (–CHCH–) or ethynylene (–CC–) linking groups, and with either singly-charged or doubly-charged pyridinium terminals. The absorption and fluorescence behavior of these dyes were compared to a commercially available fluorescent membrane stain, the styryl dye FM4-64 . The hyperpolarizabilities of all dyes were compared using hyper-Rayleigh scattering at 800 nm. Cellular uptake, localization, toxicity and phototoxicity were evaluated using tissue cell cultures (HeLa, SK-OV-3 and MDA-231). Replacing the central alkene bridge of FM4-64 with a thiophene does not substantially change the absorption, fluorescence or hyperpolarizability, whereas changing the vinylene-links to ethynylenes shifts the absorption and fluorescence to shorter wavelengths, and reduces the hyperpolarizability by about a factor of two. SHG and fluorescence imaging experiments in live cells showed that the doubly-charged thiophene dyes localize in plasma membranes, and exhibit lower internalization rates compared to FM4-64 , resulting in less signal from the cell cytosol. At a typical imaging concentration of 1 $\mu$M, the doubly-charged dyes showed no significant light or dark toxicity, whereas the singly-charged dyes are phototoxic even at 0.5 $\mu$M. The doubly-charged dyes showed phototoxicity at concentrations greater than 10 $\mu$M, although they do not generate singlet oxygen, indicating that the phototoxicity is type I rather than type II. The doubly-charged thiophene dyes are more effective than FM4-64 as SHG dyes for live cells. },

abstract = {The present study describes a new way of preparing pyrazolidine by intramolecular Raschig amination using 1,3-diaminopropane and sodium hypochlorite. A global process has been developed, involving the characterization of the reaction mechanisms, kinetic studies and the optimization of the synthesis parameters. The rates were determined as a function of the reagent concentrations, pH and temperature. The overall reaction, of the first order with respect to both reagents, is the result of two successive mechanisms: the first being pH independent, the second accelerated by increasing pH. The bimolecular rate was simulated as a function of hydroxide ion activity. The activation enthalpy and entropy of the molecular process were established at 25 °C. A kinetic model is proposed and then validated by the experimental results. Finally, it was found that the yield of pyrazolidine essentially depends on the ratio p ([1,3-diaminopropane]0/[sodium hypochlorite]0) of the initial molar concentrations and the ratio of the rates k2/k1 (k1: rate of the N,N-dichloro-1,3-diaminopropane formation and k2: rate of N-chloro-1,3 diaminopropane formation).},

    abstract = {A series of polyaromatic luminophores based on pyrene pyrazoline containing donor-acceptor $\pi$-conjugation extended through naphthalene (PPN), anthracene (PPA) and pyrene (PPP) were designed and synthesized. They exhibited high glass transition temperatures and high thermal stability. Fluorescence shifted to longer wavelength while moving from solution state emission (blue to greenish yellow) to solid state and thin film emission (yellow, orange, red), further, electron accepting ability also increased with polyaryl substituents. PPN exhibited dual emission in solution, solid state and thin film. The purity of color emission was confirmed from CIE values. The luminogens reveal typical AIE (PPN, PPA) and AIBSE (PPP) features of twisted molecular conformation into aggregation of molecules arranged in J and H type aggregations. Solvatochromism observed as prominent blue to yellow emission shift, large Stokes shift in D-A of twisted molecular geometry and intramolecular charge transfer in various solvents. They demonstrate dual emission in nonpolar solvents with twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. The lifetime analysis of TCSPC revealed longer and shorter lifetime values in the excited state. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry disclosed phase transition between crystalline and amorphous states. The single beam Z-scan analysis revealed third order nonlinear optical properties of the materials. They exhibited nonlinear absorption owing to saturable absorption process while negative nonlinear refraction led to self defocusing nature. DFT and TD-DFT calculations established that these luminogens are highly twisted in nature. Charge transport properties were calculated through reorganization energy and reveals that these molecules could act as electron transporting materials. Computed IP and EA values along with reorganization energy reveal that they could be used as trifunctional materials (electron, hole and emitter). The changing of polyaromatic groups in 3, 5 position of pyrazoline ring was demonstrated that it could lead to new solid state light emitters that these molecules have potential in organic optoelectronics as OLED and down conversion solar cell applications.},

Various substituted pyrazolines were oxidized to pyrazoles by irradiation with visible light/sunlight. A plausible mechanism was proposed for the light mediated oxidation proceeding via formation of intermediates with electron rich C-3 positions and electron deficient C-5 positions. Correlation between the electronic effect induced by the aryl substituents and the rate of oxidation was studied by UV–vis spectroscopy. This correlation study supported the proposed mechanism. Electron withdrawing substituents at the 3-phenyl group and electron releasing substituents at the 5-phenyl group enhanced the rate of oxidation; whereas, electron donating substituents at the 3-phenyl group and electron withdrawing substituents at the 5-phenyl group reduced the rate.},

abstract = {A series of dipolar and octupolar triphenylamine-derived dyes containing a benzothiazole positioned in the matched or mismatched fashion have been designed and synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. Linear and nonlinear optical properties of the designed molecules were tuned by an additional electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and by changing the relative positions of the donor and acceptor substituents on the heterocyclic ring. This allowed us to examine the effect of positional isomerism and extend the structure-property relationships useful in the engineering of novel heteroaromatic-based systems with enhanced two-photon absorption (TPA). The TPA cross-sections ($\delta$ TPA) in the target compounds dramatically increased with the branching of the triphenylamine core and with the strength of the auxiliary acceptor. In addition, a change from the commonly used polarity in push-pull benzothiazoles to a reverse one has been revealed as a particularly useful strategy (regioisomeric control) for enhancing TPA cross-sections and shifting the absorption and emission maxima to longer wavelengths. The maximum TPA cross-sections of the star-shaped three-branched triphenylamines are ∼500-2300 GM in the near-infrared region (740-810 nm); thereby the molecular weight normalized $\delta$ TPA/MW values of the best performing dyes within the series (2.0-2.4 GM•g -1•mol) are comparable to those of the most efficient TPA chromophores reported to date. The large TPA cross-sections combined with high emission quantum yields and large Stokes shifts make these compounds excellent candidates for various TPA applications, including two-photon fluorescence microscopy. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

    abstract = {Medical imaging is an effective medical technique used to diagnose the cancer and other diseases. To optimize medical imaging, a calibration medium or phantom with tissue-mimicking properties is required. A phantom is a specially engineered object that is used in calibration or tuning of the medical imaging modalities, specifically Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Most of the phantoms investigated were fabricated with water-based polymer gels such as carrageenan, agar, and poly(vinyl alcohol). However, due to water content fluctuation, the stability of the relaxation times, T1and T2, are problematic. Therefore, there is a demand for the development of phantoms fabricated from solid material without stability issues. Furthermore, there are potential applications of phantoms as surgical planning tools for health practitioner training. In this study, we fabricated Ultraviolet (UV)-curable silicone with various concentrations of water and hydrophilic silicone content to investigate its mechanical and imaging properties. The results demonstrate that the silicone cures faster with addition of water within 30 s to be applicable for 3D printing. Imaging properties for ultrasound, MRI and CT also demonstrated improvement with addition of water content. With optimal properties, silicone can be used to fabricate the phantom using 3D printing technique.},

The ability to interface hybrid material platforms to enhance light–matter interactions has led to the development of ultra-small and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators, low-noise frequency synthesizers and chip signal processors with orders-of-magnitude enhanced spectral resolution. On the other hand, the maturity of high-volume semiconductor processing has finally enabled the complete integration of light sources, modulators and detectors in a single microwave photonic processor chip and has ushered the creation of a complex signal processor with multifunctionality and reconfigurability similar to electronic devices. Here, we review these recent advances and discuss the impact of these new frontiers for short- and long-term applications in communications and information processing. We also take a look at the future perspectives at the intersection of integrated microwave photonics and other fields including quantum and neuromorphic photonics.},

abstract = {We synthesized three new donor-modified push-pull chromophores with the same divinylenethiophenyl bridge and tricyanofuran acceptor, but with different modified donor moieties. Structure analysis and photophysical properties were carried out to compare the molecular mobility and steric hindrance effect of different donor-modified chromophores. Density functional theory calculations and thermal properties showed the different results of chromophores' microscopic nonlinearity and thermal stability. In electro-optic activities, the poling process demonstrated that guest-host electro-optic polymers containing the chromophores with different steric hindrance and molecular free mobility, required different optimal poling condition to achieve the large macroscopic electro-optic coefficients. After the exploration of the poling condition, it showed an ultra large electro-optic coefficient (266 pm/V) for electro-optic polymer WJ5-APC-2, which indicated the fine-tuning of steric hindrance and molecular free mobility of chromophore WJ5 in host polymer APC-2. Meanwhile, steric hindrance also improved the temporal stability of electro-optic coefficients for WJ5-APC-2. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This process is traditionally accomplished with transition-metal-based catalysts. Herein, a borane-catalyzed, metal-free acceptorless dehydrogenation of saturated N-heterocycles is disclosed. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane was identified as a versatile catalyst, which afforded several synthetically important N-heteroarenes in up to quantitative yield. Specifically, the present metal-free catalytic system exhibited a uniquely high tolerance toward sulfur functionalities, and demonstrated superior reactivity in the synthesis of benzothiazoles compared to conventional metal-catalyzed systems. This protocol can thus be regarded as the first example of metal-free acceptorless dehydrogenation in synthetic organic chemistry.},

    abstract = {The high performance and low cost of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn great interest from both academic and industrial circles. The research on exploring novel efficient sensitizers, especially on inexpensive metal-free pure organic dyes, has never been suspended. The donor-$\pi$ bridge-acceptor (D-$\pi$-A) configuration is mainstream in the design of organic sensitizers due to its convenient modulation of the intramolecular charge-transfer nature. Recently, it has been found that incorporation of additional electron-withdrawing units (such as benzothiadiazole, benzotriazole, quinoxaline, phthalimide, diketopyrrolopyrrole, thienopyrazine, thiazole, triazine, cyanovinyl, cyano- and fluoro-substituted phenyl) into the $\pi$ bridge as internal acceptors, termed the D-A-$\pi$-A configuration, displays several advantages such as tuning of the molecular energy levels, red-shift of the charge-transfer absorption band, and distinct improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability. We apply the D-A-$\pi$-A concept broadly to the organic sensitizers containing additional electron-withdrawing units between electron donors and acceptors. This review is projected to summarize the category of pure organic sensitizers on the basis of the D-A-$\pi$-A feature. By comparing the structure-property relationship of typical photovoltaic D-A-$\pi$-A dyes, the important guidelines in the design of such materials are highlighted. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The emergence of "click chemistry" has revolutionized bioconjugate chemistry by providing facile reaction conditions amenable to both biologic molecules and small molecule probes such as fluorophores, toxins, or therapeutics. One particularly popular version is the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (AAC) reaction, which has spawned new alternatives such as the strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction, among others. This focused review highlights practical approaches to AAC reactions for the synthesis of peptide or protein bioconjugates and contrasts current challenges and limitations in light of recent advances in the field. The conical success of antibody drug conjugates has expanded the toolbox of linkers and payloads to facilitate practical applications of bioconjugation to create novel therapeutics and biologic probes. The AAC reaction in particular is poised to enable a large set of functionalized molecules as a combinatorial approach to high-throughput bioconjugate generation, screening, and honing of lead compounds.},

A Central Composite Design was employed to determine the maximum lactic acid concentration at optimum values for the process variables (sucrose, yeast extract, CaCO3). A satisfactory fit of the model was realized. Lactic acid production was significantly affected both by sucrose-yeast extract and sucrose-CaCO3 interactions, as well as by the negative quadratic effects of these variables. Sucrose and yeast extract had a linear effect on lactic acid production while the CaCO3 had no significant linear effect. The maximum lactic acid concentration (88.0 g/l) was obtained at concentrations for sucrose, yeast extract and CaCO3 of 89.93, 45.71 and 59.95 g/l, respectively.},

In this paper, the static first, second hyperpolarizability and its related properties estimated for pyrazole based "push-pull" dyes using B3LYP functional with 6-311G(d) basis sets. We have performed experimental calculation to determine the first hyperpolarizability using solvatochromic shift method. These dyes show high first hyperpolarizability in the range of 39.96-296.35 × 10-30 esu by theoretical method and 35.8-302 × 10-30 esu by solvatochromic shift method.},

abstract = {Though the past few decades, the development of new luminescent materials has received a lot of attention due to their applications as fluorescent sensors, in biological microscopy and in optoelectronic devices. Most of these applications are relied on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Presence of electron withdrawing N-heterocycles such as pyrazine and quinoxaline rings appeared therefore particularly interesting to be used as electron-attracting part in $\pi$-conjugated structures. Moreover, presence of nitrogen atoms with lone electron pairs allows to the pyrazine and the quinoxaline ring to act as effective and stable complexing agent or as base that can be protonated. This review reports luminescent small molecules and oligomers including a pyrazine or quinoxaline ring in their scaffold highlighting their applications related to photoluminescence and electroluminescence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {Several enantiomerically pure N(2)-substituted octahydroindazoles were prepared as bicyclic pyrazolidine derivatives of (+)-pulegone. Condensation of pulegone with hydrazine delivered a hexahydroindazole intermediate, which underwent N(2)-substitution with various electrophiles (alkyl halides, acyl chlorides, phenyl isocyanate). The resulting N(2)-substituted hexahydroindazoles could be reduced with LiBEt3H in THF to the target compounds. In addition, a N(2)- thiobenzoyl and some N(2)-carbamoyl derivatives as well as a N(1)-substituted octahydroindazole were synthesized. The compounds showed medium activity as iminium ion catalysts promoting quantitatively the Michael addition of nitroethane to cinnamaldehyde in up to 82{\%} ee for the resulting syn-diaste-reoisomer and 78{\%} ee for the anti-dia-stereoisomer. Unexpectedly, the N(2)-acyloctahydroindazoles were readily oxidized under aerobic conditions. Moreover, it was shown that an oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide to the corresponding sulfoxide is promoted by an N(2)-acyloctahydroindazole in deuterochloroform as solvent. It is proposed that the oxidation of N(2)-acyloctahydroindazoles proceeds by in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can act as an oxidant. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The amphibian tree of life. B. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. 297, 1-370] included expansion of the Southeast Asian ranid frog genus Huia from seven to 47 species, but without having studied the type species of Huia. This study tested the monophyly of this concept of Huia by sampling the type species and putative members of Huia. Molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently recovered the type species H. cavitympanum as the sister taxon to other Bornean-endemic species in the genus Meristogenys, rendering all previously published concepts of Huia as polyphyletic. Members of Huia sensu [Frost, D.R., Grant, T., Faivovich, J., Bain, R.

A clade containing the type species of Odorrana is phylogenetically unrelated to the type species of Huia, and Odorrana is removed from synonymy with Huia. These findings underscore the need to include relevant type species in phylogenetic studies before proposing sweeping taxonomic changes. The molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed a high degree of homoplasy in larval and adult morphology of Asian ranid frogs. Detailed studies are needed to identify morphological synapomorphies that unite members in these major clades of ranid frogs. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, various strategies have been developed to characterize and classify structural patterns by means of molecular descriptors. It has become possible not only to assess diversities or similarities of structure databases, but molecular descriptors also facilitate the identification of potential bioactive molecules from the rapidly increasing number of compound libraries. They even allow for a controlled de-novo design of new lead structures. This is the most comprehensive collection of molecular descriptors and presents a detailed review from the origins of this research field up to present day. This practically oriented reference book gives a thorough overview of the different molecular descriptors representations and their corresponding molecular descriptors. All descriptors are listed with their definition, symbols and labels, formulas, some numerical examples, data and molecular graphs, while numerous figures and tables aid comprehension of the definitions. Cross-references throughout, a list of acronyms and notations allow easy access to the information needed to solve a specific research problem. Examples of descriptor calculations along with tables of descriptor values for a set of selected reference compounds and an up-to-date reference list add to the practical value of the book, making it an invaluable guide for all those dealing with bioactive molecules as well as for researchers.},

The materials analysed have very different compositions and were selected with a view to determining their suitability for different applications and for further studies on applications. The results were compared to the literature to determine their similarities to UK coal fly ashes. Chemical analysis has enabled the categorisation of the ashes based on their oxide contents. Devitrification of the glass phase has been effected using suitable heat treatments and crystal phases formed are used as an indicator of glass reactivity. Based on leaching tests, certain ashes were identified as having limitations for some further uses due to the relatively high levels of leachable trace elements.

Many of the tested compounds show remarkable anti-inflammatory properties with an ulcerogenic liability (especially 4f, g, j, and k) lower than that of the standard used drug. Compound 4f was established to be the best effectively prepared anti-inflammatory active pyrazoline derivative and safer than indomethacin with respect to its ulcerogenic liability.

The compounds displayed significantly improved electro-optical properties within a polymer host after poling; values of the electric-optic coefficient of amorphous polycarbonate samples imbibed with the chromophores bearing a phenyl and a thienyl moiety were 32 and 40 pm/V, respectively, which were significantly greater than those of the polymer host bearing the chromophore which did not contain a lateral moiety (∼19 pm/V). The attachment of a lateral group to the chromophore increases electro-optic character after poling by suppressing electrostatic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, eight metal-free organic dyes ( YH-1–YH-8 ) containing olefin or acetylene as $\pi$-spacer linkages in a triarylene bridge were synthesised. Moreover, two dyes ( 1N-PPP and 1N-PPS ) without olefin and triple bonds as $\pi$-spacer linkages were used as references. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes were characterised, and the dyes were then used to fabricate dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). We demonstrated the use of a D–$\pi$–A dipolar system by employing arylamine derivatives as an electron donor, triarylene with iterative olefin or acetylene as a $\pi$-bridge, and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor. YH-1 had olefin as a repeating unit in the triarylene bridge and exhibited broad absorption, favourable short-circuit photocurrent density ( J sc ), and favourable open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) when used in a film morphology with DCA as a coabsorbent. The optimal device exhibited a J sc of 16.23 mA cm −2 , a V oc of 650 mV, and a fill factor of 0.67, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.08{\%}. The photophysical properties of the DSSCs were analysed using time-dependent density functional theory with the B3LYP functional. },

An intense fluorescence of dyes has been observed in non-polar solvents with cinnamoyl fragments having electron-donating substituents or several double bonds in the polymethine chain.

We envisaged that disconnections between L-leucine and the HIP group (2S,4S) and between L-threonine and isostatine (3S,4R,SS) would afford two units: a HIP-isostatine unit (I) and a tctrapeptide unit (11). The HIP-isostatine unit was synthesized stereoselectively, and a convergent strategy was used to construct thc tetrapeptide. The two units were coupled to afford a linear precursor which was cyclized after appropriate functionalization. Macrocyclization was accomplished at the carboxylic acid of the HIP unit and the free amino group of leucine by using diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA). After selective deprotection of the hydroxyl and amino groups of the macrocycle, the substituents attached to the amino group of L-threonine were introduced by using benzotriazol- 1 -yloxytris(dimethylamino)- phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP).},

This work demonstrates that the distribution of 2-pyrazoline products is highly dependent on the relative configuration of the substituents on the 1-pyrazoline intermediate. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

    abstract = {Background. There is a striking male predominance in esophageal cancer patients. Sex hormones have been suggested as a contributing factor and these are influenced by age and race. In this study, we examined the male-to-female incidence rate ratios of esophageal cancer in the United States. Methods. We used data from 13 registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to calculate male-to-female incidence rate ratios of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) diagnosed during 1992-2006 in different age and race groups. Results. For EA, all races had similar sex and age-specific incidence patterns showing a peak in the male-to-female incidence rate ratio in the age group 50-59, and an age-related decline thereafter. The highest male-to-female ratio was seen in Hispanics (20.5) and the lowest in Blacks (7.0) compared with 10.8 in Whites. By contrast, the male-to-female incidence rate ratios were low and fairly stable throughout the different age groups in ESCC. Conclusion. The male-to-female incidence rate ratios in esophageal cancer vary considerably according to histology, age, and race. The highest sex ratios were seen in EA in the age group 50-59, rendering plausibility to the hypothesis that female sex hormone exposure may play a protective role in the development of this cancer.},

    abstract = {Demand for lactic acid is growing, especially, for its use in the production of biodegradable polymer (polylactate). The current method of production and separation of lactic acid is both expensive and unsustainable. This is partly due to the cost and lower efficiency of the current method for separating the lactic acid product from the fermentation media. Therefore, the development of alternative technology that will offer efficiency, economic and environmental benefits is of great importance. One of the promising technologies for recovery of lactic acid from fermentation broth is reactive liquid-liquid extraction. In this paper, processes based on reactive extraction of lactic acid into an organic phase and its recovery into an aqueous phase is examined. The percentages of extraction and recovery are determined by using a small pilot-scale microporous hollow-fibre membrane module (HFMM). Firstly, equilibrium experiments were conducted using organic solutions consisting of Aliquat 336 and trioctylamine (as carriers) and tributyl phosphate and sunflower oil (as solvents) The values of the distribution co-efficient (defined as a ratio of the concentration of lactic acid extracted over that remaining in the aqueous solution at equilibrium) were obtained as a function of feed pH (range 4.0-6.5), composition of the organic phase (ratio of carrier to solvent) and temperature (range 8-40°C). The best extraction was obtained with the organic phase of 15wt{\%} tri-octylamine (TOA), 15{\%} aliquat 336 dissolved in 35 wt{\%} tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) and 35{\%} sunflower oil. The percentage extraction from 0.1 M was approx. 70{\%} after 4 h at pH 5.0 and at 35°C at a recirculating flow rate of 15-20 L/h. Lactic acid was reextracted from the organic phase by using 0.5 M sodium carbonate solution and approx. 90{\%} recovery was obtained in 4 h. These results demonstrate that good extraction and recovery of lactic acid in the hollow-fibre membrane are possible. Also because of its potential for application in situ the process would allow to maintain lactic acid concentration at low levels during the fermentation and to improve productivity by suppressing the product inhibition effects. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

    abstract = {The M2 proton channel from influenza A virus, a prototype for a class of viral ion channels known as viroporins, conducts protons along a chain of water molecules and ionizable sidechains, including His37. Recent studies highlight a delicate interplay between protein folding, proton binding, and proton conduction through the channel. Drugs inhibit proton conduction by binding to an aqueous cavity adjacent to M2's proton-selective filter, thereby blocking access of proton to the filter, and altering the energetic landscape of the channel and the energetics of proton-binding to His37. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The synthesized polymers were characterized by standard techniques such as, GPC, SEM, TGA, FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies by cyclic voltammetry analyses. The Pyrazoline group hooked with different aryl donors such as benzene, thiophene, carbazole, triphenylamine, thus results a series of blue and green emitting materials. The obtained optical bandgap energy of the polymers (PPY I-IV) were 2.53, 3.41, 3.07, 3.10 eV respectively, suggest that all the polymers belongs to semiconducting category. The solvent effect of polymers was thoroughly studied and explained by Lippert-Mataga equation.

Thanks to the presence of the self-assembly effect, the NLO effect and stability of these polymers were enhanced in a large degree. The NLO coefficient of P4 reached up to 166.7 pm V?1, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the new record reported so far for linear polymers using simple azobenzenes as the chromophore moieties.},

The best result was obtained with chromophore C5, bearing fluorinated aromatic substituents, which shows a doubling of the EO activity at 30 wt{\%} (25 pm V−1 at 830 nm) compared with the pristine TCVDPA. The bulkier the chromophore, the lower the induced plasticization effect (as much as 50 °C difference on the Tg attenuation). Furthermore, all chromophores in this study possess good processability and exhibit high thermal decomposition temperatures (highest Td = 360 °C).},

    abstract = {The importance of nonlinear optical phenomena has been known for some time, however, since the mid‐1980s, there has been an explosion of interest in the search for and development of non‐linear optical materials that possess commercial device applications. To date, the systems have been utilized in information processing, optical switching, optical frequency conversion, and telecommunications, and with the advancing development of optotechnology, burgeoning demands for suitable materials are becoming apparent. Of the many systems studied for example inorganic crystals and semiconductors, organic crystalline monomers, and long‐chain polymers with delocalized $\pi$ electrons, no one species has proved to be all‐encompassing, with advantages for one application being negated by disadvantages for another. This is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future with the criteria of the application governing the type of material used. However, chemists are gradually elucidating what actually governs second‐ and third‐order nonlinear activity and thereby, tailoring species to show greater effects. In recent years, organometallic compounds, through their unique characteristics such as diversity of metals, oxidation states, ligands, and geometries, have found success and brought a new dimension to the area. This review attempts, with critical appraisal, to bring the discussion of organometallic nonlinear optical systems up to date, as well as giving a brief but general introduction to the field of nonlinear optics.

The system employed the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction to effect efficient cross-linking. The first component was a dendrimer containing multiple electro-optic chromophore substituents surrounded by an outer periphery possessing diene functionality. The second was a furan-protected, bis-dienophile electro-optic chromophore, introduced in order to function as a nonlinear optically-active cross-linking agent. The initial glass-transition temperature of the material was tuned by the addition of the third component, an optically-inert, maleimide-based dienophile cross-linking agent. Tuning of this mixture allowed optimum poling temperature to coincide with optimum thermal conditions for promotion of the Diels–Alder cross-linking reaction. The electro-optic properties of the material were evaluated in real-time, using a reflection-based single-beam ellipsometry apparatus that was modified to perform in situ signal monitoring. The high electro-optic activity observed (r33 of 150 pm V−1), was thermally stable up to 130 °C (a 48 °C improvement over similar uncross-linked materials). After processing, materials were insoluble in acetone, retained 90{\%} of their original r33 after 15 months at room temperature, and performed well in accelerated operational testing at 85 °C in air.},

Nonlinear photonic crystals, whose refractive-index distribution can be tuned optically, have been used to demonstrate all-optical switching. However, a high pump intensity is usually required because the nonlinear optical coefficient of conventional materials is relatively small. Here we report ultrafast and low-power photonic-crystal all-optical switching based on strong optical nonlinearity enhancement due to excited-state interelectron transfer. Compared with the case without nonlinearity enhancement, the switching operation power is reduced by four orders of magnitude while the ultrafast response time, of the order of a picosecond, is maintained. This provides a strategy for constructing photonic materials with large nonlinearity and studying ultrafast low-power integrated photonic devices. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

Its uniqueness to the virus and its critical role in the viral life cycle makes IN suitable for selective inhibition. The recent approval of Raltegravir (MK-0518) has created a surge in interest and great optimism in the field. In our ongoing IN drug design research, we herein report the discovery of substituted analogs of 3-acetyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyranones and their difluoridoborate complexes as novel IN inhibitors. In many of these compounds, complexation with boron difluoride increased the potency and selectivity of IN inhibition.

Stack energy consumption averaged 0.6 kW h kg-1 lactate transported at current efficiencies in the 90{\%} range. Under optimum feed concentration (125 g l-1) and process conditions (auto-current mode with conductivity setpoints of minimum 5 and maximum 40 mS cm-1), lactate flux reached 300 g m-2 h-1 and water flux were low for mono-polar electrodialysis averaging 0.3 kg H2O per M lactate transported. Glucose in the concentrate stream solutions was reduced to {\textless}2 g l-1. Acetate impurities enriched from about 0.5 g l-1 in the feed stream to 1.5 g l-1 in the concentrate stream solutions. After mono-polar electrodialysis, the concentrated sodium lactate solutions were further purified using bi-polar electrodialysis. Water transport during bi-polar electrodialysis reached figures of 0.070-0.222 kg H2O per M lactate. Free lactic acid concentration reached 16{\%} with lactate flux of up to 300 g m-2 h-1.
